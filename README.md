Problem Set and Programming Assignment Solutions in C++ to Stanford University's Algorithms Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

**Instructor**: [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768)

## Introduction
This repository contains the courseWork Algorithms, problem set and programming assignment solutions in C/C++ to the specialization. On Coursera, the specialization consists of four courses.

The problem set and programming assignment solutions are uploaded only for reference purposes. Please attempt the quizzes and programming assignments yourself and only look at the solutions/explanations if you find that you still can't understand it after consulting the discussion forums and reviewing the lecture content. I hope there is no misuse of the reference content.
