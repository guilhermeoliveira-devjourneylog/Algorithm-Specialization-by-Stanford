Problem Set, Programming Assignment Solutions and Coursework in C++ to Stanford University's Algorithms Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

**Instructor**: [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768)

## Introduction
This repository contains the courseWork Algorithms, problem set and programming assignment solutions in C/C++ to the specialization. On Coursera, the specialization consists of four courses.

#### NOTE 
***
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="2">Dear Aspirants,<br>
I encourage you to use the code and solutions available on GitHub as a reference to learn and deepen your understanding of programming concepts. However, we strongly advise against using the code and solutions to complete your coursework without attempting the exercises yourself.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Learning to code requires practice and problem-solving skills, and simply copying code without understanding it will hinder your progress in the long run. Instead, use the code and solutions as a reference to guide your learning and understanding of the concepts.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Remember, the purpose of education is not just to pass a course but to develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in your career. So, we urge you to take the time to learn and practice the material, and use the available resources as a tool to enhance your learning.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Happy coding!</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="11">Sincerely,<br>
Mrunal Nirajkumar Shah</p>
